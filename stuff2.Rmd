This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## IAccessing County Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
options(geonamesUsername = "fc2b8ab97918d4849e73d7e6ab058bf85a38cef2")
# Set username to my username

getOption("geonamesUsername")
# Get key

#countryInfo <- census_api_key("fc2b8ab97918d4849e73d7e6ab058bf85a38cef2", install = TRUE)
# Log in to information
```
```{r}
view(load_variables(year = 2017, dataset = "acs5"))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
